            The agent is designed to automate the process of conducting literature reviews by gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing information from multiple sources. It uses a combination of Google searches and Arxiv database queries to fetch relevant academic papers and data, subsequently generating a well-formatted report.

            ## How It Works
            The agent handles requests to perform literature reviews. It utilizes a set of assistant agents, including Google and Arxiv search agents, to gather information. Once the data is collected, a report agent synthesizes the information into a structured literature review, ensuring that references are correctly formatted. The process involves a round-robin communication strategy among the participating agents, with a termination condition for task completion.

            ## Input Parameters
            - **text** (string) – Contains the text query or topic for which the literature review is to be conducted.

            ## Key Features
            - **Automated Literature Review** – Conducts thorough searches across Google and Arxiv to gather relevant academic information.
            - **Structured Report Generation** – Compiles and formats the search results into a coherent literature review with proper references.
            - **Multi-Source Data Collection** – Leverages both general web searches and academic databases for comprehensive data gathering.
            - **Dynamic Agent Collaboration** – Uses a round-robin approach to coordinate between search and report agents.
