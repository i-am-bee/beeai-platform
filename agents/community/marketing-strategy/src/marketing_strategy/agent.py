            The agent conducts in-depth marketing strategy analysis for projects by leveraging a coordinated crew of
            agents with specific roles. It breaks down the process into sequential tasks, each handled by specialized 
            agents such as the Lead Market Analyst, Chief Marketing Strategist, and Creative Content Creator. This 
            approach ensures that the final output is a well-rounded and actionable marketing strategy tailored to the 
            project's needs.

            ## How It Works
            The agent initializes a server where it registers a "marketing-strategy" agent, which analyzes projects by 
            executing a series of tasks. Each task is managed by a specific agent, with their outputs feeding into 
            subsequent tasks. The Lead Market Analyst conducts initial research, the Chief Marketing Strategist 
            formulates strategies, and the Creative Content Creator develops campaign ideas and marketing copies. 
            The process is executed asynchronously to enhance performance and efficiency.

            ## Input Parameters
            - **text** (string) – A text which describes the project for which the marketing strategy is to be developed.

            ## Key Features
            - **Multi-Agent Coordination** – Utilizes multiple specialized agents to perform distinct tasks in the 
            marketing strategy process.
            - **Sequential Task Execution** – The agents execute tasks in a predefined order to ensure comprehensive 
            strategy formulation.
            - **Asynchronous Processing** – Enhances efficiency by running tasks asynchronously within the framework.
