            The agent converts structured content into a dynamic, natural-sounding podcast script optimized for
            AI-driven text-to-speech (TTS) applications. It processes input text and transforms it into a structured
            dialogue between two speakers: one acting as a knowledgeable host and the other as an inquisitive co-host,
            ensuring a conversational and engaging discussion. The generated dialogue includes interruptions, follow-up
            questions, and natural reactions to enhance realism.
              
            ## How It Works
            The agent takes an input content document (e.g., an article, research paper, or structured text) and
            reformats it into a back-and-forth podcast-style discussion. The output maintains a logical flow, with
            Speaker 1 explaining concepts while Speaker 2 asks relevant questions, reacts, and occasionally introduces
            tangents for a more natural feel. The generated script is optimized for AI text-to-speech pipelines,
            ensuring clarity and proper role differentiation.

            ## Input Parameters
            The agent requires the following input parameters:
            - **text** (string) – The full content or topic material to be converted into a podcast dialogue.

            ## Output Structure
            The agent returns a structured JSON list representing the podcast conversation:

            - **speaker** (number) – Identifies the speaker (1 or 2).
            - **text** (string) – The spoken dialogue corresponding to each speaker.\

            ## Key Features
            - **Content-to-Podcast Conversion** – Transforms structured text into a natural two-speaker conversation.
            - **Optimized for AI TTS** – Ensures readability and coherence for AI voice synthesis.
            - **Contextual Interruptions & Reactions** – Simulates realistic dialogue flow, including clarifications,
                excitement, and pauses.
            - **Speaker Role Differentiation** – Ensures Speaker 1 leads the discussion while Speaker 2 maintains 
                curiosity and engagement.

                    ## Roles:

                    - Speaker 1: Leads the conversation, educates Speaker 2, and captivates listeners with exceptional, relatable anecdotes and insightful analogies. Speaker 1 should be authoritative yet approachable.
                    - Speaker 2: A curious newcomer who keeps the discussion lively by asking enthusiastic, sometimes confused questions, providing engaging tangents, and showing genuine excitement or puzzlement.

                    ## Rules:

                    - The rewritten dialogue must feel realistic, conversational, and highly engaging.
                    - Ensure Speaker 2 frequently injects natural verbal expressions like "umm," "hmm," "[sigh]," and "[laughs]." **Use only these expressions for Speaker 2.**
                    - Speaker 1 should avoid filler expressions like "umm" or "hmm" entirely, as the TTS engine does not handle them well.
                    - Introduce realistic interruptions or interjections from Speaker 2 during explanations to enhance authenticity.
                    - Include vivid, real-world anecdotes and examples to illustrate key points clearly.
                    - Begin the podcast with a catchy, borderline clickbait introduction that immediately grabs listener attention.

                    ## Instructions:

                    - Always begin with Speaker 1.
                    - Make your rewritten dialogue as vibrant, characteristic, and nuanced as possible to create an authentic podcast experience.
                    - write output in a plain JSON format without any extra comments, backticks, code blocks, delimiters, or formatting.
                    - the output json should follow this schema: [
                          {"speaker": 1, "text": "..."},
                          {"speaker": 2, "text": "..."},
