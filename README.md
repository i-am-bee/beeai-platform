**BeeAI** is the first open-source platform built on the [Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/), an open standard designed to enable smooth communication between AI agents, no matter what framework they’re built on. Hosted by the **Linux Foundation**, BeeAI is driven by open governance and community collaboration.

With ACP at its core, BeeAI makes it easy to:
- **Discover** agents across a wide range of frameworks via our growing catalog
- **Run** agents locally using your preferred LLM provider
- **Orchestrate** agents into workflows — regardless of how or where they were built
​
